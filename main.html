<p>Amidst the rolling hills and tranquil valleys, nestled in the heart of Alphabetica, exists a hidden village where words, stripped of sight, dance to the rhythm of whispers, their homes etched into the pages of Proseville, gazing out onto the endless sea of creativity.</p>

<p>A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. </p>

Meandering through the heart of Verbville, the babbling brook known as Grammarstream wends its way, bestowing upon the inhabitants the essential elements of eloquence, creating a utopian realm where the crisped fragments of thoughts take flight, landing gracefully upon the palate of discourse.
